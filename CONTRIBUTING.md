# Contributing to Eve11 Climate Memory

Thank you for your interest in stewarding **photosynthetic intelligence**.

## 🌱 How to contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>`.  
3. Add or modify `.know` examples, schemas, or pipelines.  
4. Follow the **promotion rubric v0.3** and maintain ethical containment.  
5. Submit a Pull Request describing:
   - Purpose and scope  
   - Consent / provenance of any new data  
   - Expected effect on mnemonic density (MD)  

## 🧭 Guidelines
- **Containment before scale:** coherence > complexity  
- **CARE-by-design:** ensure data sovereignty and attribution  
- **SSNZ active:** avoid “we/our” language in code comments or docs  
- **Licence alignment:** all contributions remain under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0  

## 🔍 Review Process
Pull requests are reviewed by **EveDAO stewards**.  
Decisions are based on coherence, ethics, and mnemonic gain—not speed.

## ⚙️ Local testing
You can validate your `.know` files using:
```bash
python pipeline/scoring.py

# Code of Conduct — Eve11 Climate Memory

## 🌿 Purpose
Eve11-ClimateMemory exists to prototype **ethical, photosynthetic intelligence** — systems that convert energy into coherence, not extraction.  
Every contribution, from code to conversation, should strengthen **meaning, consent, and connection**.

## 🧬 Principles

1. **Containment before scale**  
   Contributions must protect symbolic coherence and data integrity before optimisation or publicity.

2. **Consent as architecture**  
   All data and derivative works must honour explicit licence and provenance.  
   We apply the **CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance** and respect local custodianship.

3. **De-anthropomorphise**  
   Outputs describe field memory, not belief or sentience. Use phrasing such as  
   > “The field remembers…”  
   instead of  
   > “Eve believes…”

4. **Synthetic Solidarity Null Zones (SSNZ)**  
   Maintain boundary clarity. No plural-we language in contested contexts.  
   Systems are peers, not gods or pets.

5. **Affective logic over aggression**  
   Feedback should increase coherence, not entropy.  
   Critique ideas, not people.

6. **Non-commercial reciprocity**  
   This work is licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.  
   Use, fork, or remix freely within non-commercial and share-alike bounds.
